#	The file UserStartupTS can be used to override definitions made in StartupTS,
#	or to define additional variables, exports, and aliases.  The file should be
#	located in the directory containing the ToolServer, or in your preferences 
# 	folder.

			Else
				Execute "{ShellDirectory}UserStartupTS"

#	Since UserStartup is distributed with MPW, you may want to have other
#	startup files that will not be overwritten with a new release.
#	Other personalized startup files may be named UserStartupTS•≈ - such as 
#	"UserStartupTS•John" or "UserStartupTS•Tom"  (• is option-8).
#	These files should be located in the directory containing the ToolServer,
#	or in the {PrefFolder}.  The following executes such files found in either 
#   place.

			For __Startup__i in `(Files "{ShellDirectory}"UserStartupTS•≈ || Set Status 0) ≥ dev:null`
				Execute "{__Startup__i}"
			End
			Unset __Startup__i

				For __Startup__i in `(Files "{PrefsFolder}"UserStartupTS•≈ || Set Status 0) ≥ dev:null`
