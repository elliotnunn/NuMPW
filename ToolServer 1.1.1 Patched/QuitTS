#	The ToolServer overwrites the log file each time it runs.  If you wish to
#	save a copy, uncomment the following line.

#		rename -y {ShellDirectory}ToolServer.Log	{ShellDirectory}ToolServer.Log.Save

#	Since QuitTS is distributed with MPW, you may want to have other
#	"QuitTS" scripts that will not be overwritten with a new release.
#	Other personalized quit scripts may be named QuitTS•≈ - such as 
#	"QuitTS•John" or "QuitTS•Tom"  (• is option-8).
#	These files should be located in the directory containing the ToolServer
#	or in the MPW Preferences folder.  The following executes such files found
# 	in either place.

			For __Quit__i in `(Files "{ShellDirectory}"QuitTS•≈ || Set Status 0) ≥ dev:null`
				Execute "{__Quit__i}"
			End

			If "{PrefsFolder}"
				For __Quit__i in `(Files "{PrefsFolder}"QuitTS•≈ || Set Status 0) ≥ dev:null`
					Execute "{__Quit__i}"
				End
				Unset __Quit__i
			End
