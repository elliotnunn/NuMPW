ð CarbonLib 1.3.1 Sample CodeThis folder contains several pieces of sample code that demonstrate usage of the Carbon API. AppearanceSampleThis is the Carbon version of the Appearance Sample sample code. Please get this sample from Mac OS X at Developer/Examples/Carbon/AppearanceSample.BasicPlugInA simple CFPlugIn shell app. It is a known issue that only a Mach-o version will run on Mac OS X; the CFM version will only run on 8/6/9.x.BasicRAELA simple Carbon-based RunApplicationEventLoop shell app.BasicWNEA simple Carbon-based WaitNextEvent shell app.BasicDataBrowserA simple example of creating a Data Browser. In addition, this sample uses Carbon events and demonstrates some of the macros available in Debugging.h.CallIORegistryMake a call from a CFM app to a Mach-o CFBundle on Mac OS X. Get information about the box on which you are running from the IORegistry.CallMachOFrameworkThis sample shows two ways of calling a Mach-O framework from a CFM application on Mac OS X. CFM_MachO_CFMThis sample demonstrates how to call a Mach-O function which takes a callback function pointer as a parameter. The main CFM application readies the callback function by calling a routine MachOFunctionPointerForCFMFunctionPointer() which generates power pc assembly glue to call the passed in function pointer. This generated glue is then passed to the Mach-O routine as the callback parameter.Converter_nibThe Converter_nib sample illustrates the use of nib files (containing UI elements) in a Carbon application. This works in Mac OS 8.6/9 as well as in Mac OS X.  Nib files can be created using Interface Builder on Mac OS X and can be used in applications which link against CarbonLib 1.2 and higher.  In addition, the Converter item in the top level of the folder is a bundled or packaged application. You can see it's contents by using PackageTool to unset the bundle bit, i.e., drop the Converter package onto PackageTool and select "folder".HTMLSampleHTMLSample illustrates how to use the HTMLRenderingLib services. You can find this sample in the PackageTool sample's Sample Package folder.MLTEEditPaneIllustrates usage of user pane controls that provide MLTE functionality.MLTESampleCarbonMLTESampleCarbon is an example application that demonstrates the fundamental MLTE toolbox calls in a CarbonLib context; it does not demonstrate all the techniques you need for a large application.NavSampleShows how to use the Navigation Services API, including the new (post-Public Beta) Mac OS X Nav api..PackageToolIllustrates how to create application packages in Mac OS 9. PrintSampleIllustrates the use of Carbon print functions as defined in PMApplication.h.QTShellCarbonDemonstrates how to add QuickTime movie support into an application.SimpleTextA simple document editing application sample. Please get this sample from Mac OS X at Developer/Examples/Carbon/SimpleText.SimplerTextA very simple document editing application sample which uses Carbon Events.MoreFilesSupport for working with files.SomePre8.5MenuAPI.cBecause they've been removed from CarbonAccessors.o,	here are pre-8.5 APIs sources for: InvalWindowRect, ValidWindowRect, InvalWindowRgn, ValidWindowRgn, EnableMenuItem,  	DisableMenuItem.LDataBrowserPowerPoint wrapper classes and Constructor templates for DataBrowser.Type Services for UnicodeThis sample exercises some of the ATSUI (Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging) API.If you are attempting to build any of the samples in this sample code folder with Metrowerks Codewarrior, please be sure to install the Carbon Support folder as per the instructions in the Carbon Porting Guide in the Documentation folder.These samples include project files for Metrowerks Codewarrior, Project Builder and MPW.Warning: Moving a project from CodeWarrior Pro 4 to earlier CodeWarrior versions may result in the loss of Prefix File information in the C/C++ Language Preferences panel. Many of the sample code examples on this SDK make use of a prefix file (usually CarbonPrefix.h or the CarbonHeaders.h pre-compiled header) to define TARGET_API_MAC_CARBON, so if you do attempt to build a sample on a pre-CW4 system, you may need to reinstate the prefix file information.UPDATES=========A CarbonLib SDK is also available from the Apple Developer ftp seeding site at <http://developer.apple.com/sdk/>.Other additional information, updates, and the latest news can be found on our Carbon website, at <http://developer.apple.com/carbon/>. Updates for a Carbon-compliant MacApp can be obtained from <http://macapp.apple.com>.SUPPORT=========Technical support for the contents of this SDK will be provided by the usual channels to Apple Developer Program members.
