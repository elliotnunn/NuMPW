Startup etcTS -  StartupTS and QuitTS ExamplesCopyright Apple Computer, Inc. 1987,1992All rights reserved.This file contains a number of ideas for modifying the StartupTS, and QuitTS scripts.StartupTS			-	executed when starting ToolServerUserStartupTS		-	executed from StartupTSQuitTS				-  executed before quitting ToolServerRelocating the MPW Folder	Normally ToolServer is installed in a folder called MPW on the boot disk.	It's important for the MPW system to know the location of this folder,	so that the tools, scripts, libraries, include files, etc. that make	up MPW can be easily located.  You can change the name of the MPW	folder, or move it to another disk or directory, without making	any changes in the StartupTS file, as long as you keep ToolServer	in the same folder.	Variable {MPW}, defined in the StartupTS file, specifies the folder	that contains the MPW system.  The following line in the StartupTS	file specifies the default location:		Set MPW "{ShellDirectory}"	This defines the location of the MPW system to be in the directory	containing ToolServer.  If you keep ToolServer 	on the desktop, you should define MPW to be the full path name of	the directory containing the rest of the MPW system, for example:		Set MPW "{Boot}MPW"Multiple UserStartupTS Scripts	You may have multiple user startup scripts.  Any script in the	{MPW} folder named UserStartupTS¥Å will be executed from StartupTS	after executing UserStartupTS.		You can also set up your system to run a different UserStartupTS	depending on the directory from which you start ToolServer.  To do this	you will need to change one line of the StartupTS script, and put	a UserStartupTS script in the different directories containing	the files that you usually open from the Finder.  In the StartupTS	script change:			Execute "{ShellDirectory}UserStartupTS"	to:			Execute UserStartupTS		When you start ToolServer by opening a document in the Finder, 	the directory of that document is your default directory.  	The UserStartupTS in that directory will then be executed rather	than the default UserStartupTS.			State Saving	The StateTS script writes the current variable definitions, exports,	aliases, and the default directory, to standard output.  This state	information is written in the form of commands that may be used later	to restore the state.  The date is included in the first line of output.	To see the State script, execute the following:		Open "{MPW}"Examples:StateTS	Important:	In order to use the StateTS script, you must move it to a	directory where ToolServer looks for commands.		Duplicate "{MPW}"Examples:StateTS "{MPW}"Scripts:	To save the state information in a file, execute a command such as		StateTS > XYZ.Startup1TS	The state can then be restored by executing the following:		Execute XYZ.Startup1TS
