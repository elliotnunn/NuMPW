c_sample~~~~~~~~This very simple piece of sample code demonstrates how to build a C applicationusing the tools for creating native Power Macintosh applications. You can alsobuild a 68K version of the application and combine it with the native PowerMacintosh version to create a 'fat' application containing both 68K and PowerMacintosh versions.To build the 'FAT' version (combined 68K and Power Macintosh versions), use:	make -f c_sample.make>temp	tempThis produces the 'Fat' application, c_sample, that is runnable on both a 68Kand a Power Macintosh. (As a side effect, the non-fat applications, c_sample.ppcand c_sample.68K, are built.)To build the 68K Macintosh version, use:	make -f c_sample.make c_sample.68K>temp	tempThis produces the application, c_sample.68K, that runs on both a 68K Macintoshand (in emulation mode) on a Power Macintosh.To build the native Power Macintosh version, use:	make -f c_sample.make c_sample.ppc>temp	tempThis produces the application, c_sample.ppc, that runs only on a Power Macintosh.If you wish to build a debuggable version, add the option "-d SymOpt=on" to thecommand line:	make -e -f c_sample.make -d SymOpt=on>temp  # (-e forces everything to be rebuilt)	tempThis will rebuild the application with debugging symbols turned on so that youcan debug it with the Power Mac Debugger. The symbols are stored in the filecalled c_sample.ppc.xcoff.
