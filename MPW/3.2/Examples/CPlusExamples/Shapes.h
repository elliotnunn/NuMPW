#
#   There are four main classes in this program. Each of
#   these classes has a definition (.h) file and an
#   implementation (.cp) file.  
#   
#   The TApplication class does all of the basic event
#   handling and initialization necessary for Mac Toolbox
#   applications. It maintains a list of TDocument objects,
#   and passes events to the correct TDocument class when
#   apropriate. 
#   
#   The TDocument class does all of the basic document
#   handling work. TDocuments are objects that are
#   associated with a window. Methods are provided to deal
#   with update, activate, mouse-click, key down, and other
#   events. Some additional classes which implement a
#   linked list of TDocument objects are provided. 
#   
#   The TApplication and TDocument classes together define
#   a basic framework for Mac applications, without having
#   any specific knowledge about the type of data being
#   displayed by the application's documents. They are a
#   (very) crude implementation of the MacApp application
#   model, without the sophisticated view heirarchies or
#   any real error handling. 
#   
#   The TShapesApp class is a subclass of TApplication. It
#   overrides several TApplication methods, including those
#   for handling menu commands and cursor adjustment, and
#   it does some necessary initialization.
#   
#   The TShapesDocument class is a subclass of TDocument. This
#   class contains most of the special purpose code for
#   shape drawing. In addition to overriding several of the
#   TDocument methods, it defines a few additional
#   methods which are used by the TShapesApp class to get
#   information on the document state.
