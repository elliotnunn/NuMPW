#
#	Executing this script will copy the result files of the TEDocument class
#	to the MPW C++ libraries and includes folders. Once there, the TEDocument
#	class can be included for use by other code.
#
#	Therefore, don't execute this script unless you are satisfied that any
#	changes you may have made to the source code are exactly as you want them.
#
#	Of course, you can always copy these files using the finder by dragging
#	each to its appropriate place. This script is only meant to be a convenience.

#	Copy the TEDocument header files to the C++ Includes folder
		Duplicate 'TECommon.h' "{CPlusIncludes}"TECommon.h
		Duplicate 'TEDocument.h' "{CPlusIncludes}"TEDocument.h
	
#	Copy the TEDocument library to the C++ Libraries folder
		Duplicate 'TEDocument.o' "{CPlusLibraries}"TEDocument.o
		
#	By the way, if you wish to always overwrite any previously existing copies
#	of these files in the C++ Libraries and Includes folders, use the -y option
#	in the duplicate command.
