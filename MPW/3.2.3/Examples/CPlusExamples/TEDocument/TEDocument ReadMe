#	TEDocument ReadMe
#
#	By collecting files of a particular classes into its own
#	folder, the programmer can make initial modifications to
#	the class without impacting other code which relies on it.
#
#	Once changes are made and are debugged to the satisfaction
#	of the programmer, then the result files (including all 
#	header files) can be copied to the appropriate C++ Libraries
#	and Includes folders where they would be accessible to other
#	code.
#
#	The source code of the TEDocument should be self explanatory.
#	As TEDocument is a subclass of TDocument, it may be useful
#	to review that base class.
#
#	Besides this ReadMe file, a MPW script named GlobalizeTEDocument
#	is included to simplify duplicating the result files to the
#	appropriate C++ Libraries and Includes folders. However, there
#	no need to perform this operation as there is already a current
#	copy of these files in those folders; unless you make changes
#	to the source files and wish to make them available for use by
#	other code.
