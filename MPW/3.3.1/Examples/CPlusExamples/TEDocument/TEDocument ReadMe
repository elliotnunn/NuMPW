#	TEDocument ReadMe
#
#	By collecting files of a particular classes into its own
#	folder, the programmer can make initial modifications to
#	the class without impacting other code which relies on it.
#
#	Once changes are made and are debugged to the satisfaction
#	of the programmer, then the result files (including all 
#	header files) can be copied to the appropriate C++ Libraries
#	and Includes folders where they would be accessible to other
#	code.
#
#	The source code of the TEDocument should be self explanatory.
#	As TEDocument is a subclass of TDocument, it may be useful
#	to review that base class.
