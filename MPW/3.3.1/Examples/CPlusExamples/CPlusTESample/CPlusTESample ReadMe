#	CPlusTESample ReadMe
#
#	The source code of the CPlusTESample should be self explanatory.
#	Take note that CPlusTESample uses three objects. The first is
#	TApplication which defines the basic application framework. CPlusTESample
#	is a subclass of it and overrides member functions as needed.
#
#	In addtion, CPlusTESample uses TDocument and the TEDocument subclass to
#	create a text window with scrolling.
#
#	Once you're comfortable with the different classes and the CPlusTESample
#	implementation, you may choose to expand the various classes to support
#	fonts and colors. Also, you may choose to create different document
#	subclasses (maybe graphics?) and improved applications.
