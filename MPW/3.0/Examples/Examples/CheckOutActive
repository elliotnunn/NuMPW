#	CheckOutActive - Check the active window out for modification
#
#	Usage:	Called by a user–defined menu item
#
#	CheckOutActive uses the ProjectInfo command to determine the
#	parent project for the file open as the Active window. Once this
#	project has been determined, the file open as the Active window
#	can be properly checked out.
