With the release of the 3.4 version of the MPW Libraries on 
MPW Pro #19, the library "PPCLibraries:CPlusLib.o" has become obsolete.


"PPCLibraries:CPlusLib.o" was specific to the PPCC compiler, which has
been replaced by the MrCpp compiler.  The new "MrCPlusLib.o" and 
"MrCIOStreams.o" libraries should be used with MrCpp.  

Please read the release notes for more information.
