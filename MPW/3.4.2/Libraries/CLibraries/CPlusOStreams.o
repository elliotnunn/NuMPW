The library "CPlusOStreams.o" is obsolete
   beginning with the PreRelease environment of ETO 18
   and the Latest environment on MPW Pro 19.  

Use the CPlusLib.o and IOStreams.o libraries instead.

The C++ libraries for the 68K environment have been
split into CPlusLib.o and IOStreams.o.  The latter
contains the implementation for the C++ Streams
classes, and the former contains general C++ utility
routines, such as "operator new".

Please read the release notes.

You may safely delete this file when you are sure that all of
you're Make files have been updated.
