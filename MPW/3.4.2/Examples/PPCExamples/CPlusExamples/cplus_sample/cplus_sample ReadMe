cplus_sample
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This very simple piece of sample code demonstrates how to build a C++ application
using the tools for creating native Power Macintosh applications. You can also
build a 68K version of the application and combine it with the native Power
Macintosh version to create a 'fat' application containing both 68K and Power
Macintosh versions.

To build the 'FAT' version (combined 68K and Power Macintosh versions), use:

	make -f cplus_sample.make>temp
	temp

This produces the 'Fat' application, cplus_sample, that is runnable on both a 68K
and a Power Macintosh. (As a side effect, the non-fat applications, cplus_sample.ppc
and cplus_sample.68K, are built.)


To build the 68K Macintosh version, use:

	make -f cplus_sample.make cplus_sample.68K>temp
	temp



To build the native Power Macintosh version, use:

	make -f cplus_sample.make cplus_sample.ppc>temp
	temp



If you wish to build a debuggable version, add the option "-d SymOpt=on" to the
command line:

	make -e -f c_sample.make -d SymOpt=on>temp  # (-e forces everything to be rebuilt)
	temp

This will rebuild the application with debugging symbols turned on so that you
can debug it with the Power Mac Debugger. The symbols are stored in the file
called cplus_sample.ppc.xcoff.
