#	Since Quit is distributed with MPW, you may want to have other
#	"Quit" scripts that will not be overwritten with a new release.
#	Other personalized quit scripts may be named Quit•≈ - such as 
#	"Quit•John" or "Quit•Tom"  (• is option-8), and placed in the
#	MPW preferences folder ({PrefsFolder}).  Alternately, you may
#	place items in the Quit Items folder, located in the directory
#	containing the MPW Shell.  These items do not have any special
#	naming convention, and will be executed in alphabetical order.
#	They can also be any type of executable entity, such as scripts,
#	tools, and/or applications.
#   
#	The following executes such files found in either place.

			# this method of running custom quit scripts is obsolete, and will be removed
			# in a future version of this script.  Please move your Quit• scripts into
			# the new :Quit Items: folder.
