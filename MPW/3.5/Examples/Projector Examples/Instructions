About the Example

	The ProjectorExamples folder contains a project called "Sample".  This
	project contains a file, "Command Pages", and two subprojects: "Utilities"
	and "Commands".  "Utilites" contains two files; "Commands" contains eight.
	If you look at the folder "Sample" with the Finder, all that you will
	see is the file "ProjectorDB" and the folders that represent the two
	subprojects.  Similarly, each subproject folder only appears to 
	contain a "ProjectorDB" file. This is the normal appearance of projects 
	viewed by the Finder.  A project is seen as a folder bearing the project
	name, and containing within it two files: "ProjectorDB", which is visible to
	the Finder, and "__CurUserName", which is invisible.  "ProjectorDB" contains
	all of the project information, including the actual data of the project's
	files.
	
	These instructions will demonstrate how to mount the project, how to
	create a checkout directory structure, how to get information on 
	the projects and files, and how to check out files.  Other Projector
	capabilities can be investigated by following the reference documenta-
	tion, using the project in this Example as a framework for experiment-
	ation.

Mounting the Project

	You can mount the project "Sample" by executing the following line
	(select the line and press Enter).
		 
		 MountProject "{MPW}"Examples:ProjectorExamples:Sample
		 
	Now, on your Worksheet, execute the command "MountProject" with no
	arguments to demonstrate that "Sample" has been mounted.  Also, execute
	the command "Project" to demonstrate that "Sample∫" is the current project.

Creating Checkout Directories

	The most common, but not necessarily the only, way to set up Checkout 
	directories is to have their structure mimic that of the project.  To
	do this, first create a top-level folder.  For example, create a new
	folder called "CheckOut" inside the ProjectorExample folder.  This can
	be done as follows--
	
	First make ProjectorExample the current directory
	by executing
		
		Directory "{MPW}"Examples:ProjectorExamples
	
	Then execute
	
		 NewFolder CheckOut
		 
	Finally, execute the command
	
		CheckOutDir -r CheckOut
	
	You will discover that the folder "CheckOut" now has the same structure
	as the project "Sample".  That is, "CheckOut" contains two folders: 
	"Commands" and "Utilities".  What has happened is that the current project,
	Sample∫, was checked out to the directory "CheckOut".  The option -r
	specified that subprojects should be (recursively) checked out to
	subdirectories, creating the latter if necessary.

Check Out/Check In Windows

	Go to the Project menu and, in turn, select "Check In…" and "Check Out…".
	You will now see the "Check In" and "Check Out" windows on your desktop.
	For most of this exercise, you will be using the "Check Out" window.
	However, it is instructive to observe how the two windows track each
	other.  Note that "Sample" is shown as the "Current Project" at the top
	left of the "Check Out" window, and that "CheckOut" is shown as the 
	directory to the right of the legend "Checkout to:".  Also note the
	icons for the subprojects "Commands" and "Utilities" and for the file
	"Command Pages".  If you open either subproject by selecting it and
	pressing the "Open" button (or by double-clicking on the subproject),
	you will see the files belonging to that subproject.  Note the change
	in the "Checkout to:" window when a subproject is opened.  Also note
	the changes in the "Check In" window and how they follow those in the
	"Check Out" window.  Observe that you can also select projects by navi-
	gating in the pop-up labelled "Project:" at the top right of the 
	"Check In" window, and that the fields in the "Check Out" window follow
	your selections.

Info

	Press the button with the big "?" in the "Check Out" window.  Select
	in turn various files and projects and look at the information that
	is presented.  Choose and open a file, e.g. "Command Pages", and ob-
	serve the icons that correspond to the various revisions.  Select
	each revision in turn and again observe the information.  Exit 
	from the Information mode by pressing the "Done" button.

Checking Out

	Make "Sample" the current project.  Select "Command Pages" and press 
	"Check Out".  Make "Utilities" the current project by opening it.
	Press "Select All" and then press "Check Out".  Do the same with
	"Commands".  When done, you will find that the latest revision of 
	each file in the project has been checked out to the proper folder
	in the directory structure headed by "CheckOut".  If you open any of
	the files, you will discover that they are in a read-only state
	because the "Read-only" radio button in the "CheckOut" window had been
	set.
	
	For further experimentation, e.g. checking out a file for modifica-
	tion, editing it, and checking in a new revision, follow the in-
	structions in the reference manual.
