NavSample is an example application that shows programmers how to use
Navigation Services on the Mac OS.  It was formerly known as "Sampler" that
shipped with the Navigation Services 1.0 SDK.  It contains targets for Carbon and
Classic and shows "real world" usages of the interface.  It is designed to help 
developers get a jump start on using this technology.

• Building the Code
Use CodeWarrior Pro version 4.0 to build NavSample.  You must also install
the Carbon SDK into CodeWarrior. This helps you build the Carbon and
Mac OS X targets.

• Known Bugs
There are no serious bugs at this time.  

• Possible Future Enhancements
NavSample will continue to be modified, enhanced and improved according to
changes in Navigation Services and due to bug reports.
