There is an incompatibility between the StdCLib runtime library and
certain versions of the Macintosh Operating System when running on 
certain Power Macintosh machines.

The affected Operating Systems are -

	System 7.6
	System 7.6.1
	Mac OS 8.5
	Mac OS 8.5.1
	
The affected machines include -

	Power Macintosh 6100
	Power Macintosh 7100
	Power Macintosh 8100
	Power Macintosh 5200
	Macintosh PowerBook 2300

The problem occurs when StdCLib is installed in the Extensions folder, and
is due to the way the system loads and registers libraries at boot time.
The result is that programs may successfully complete execution but then 
crash with a "PowerPC access exception at AAFE0700" when exiting. 

The workaround for this problem is to install StdCLib in the MPW folder 
instead of the Extensions folder, and to put aliases to StdCLib in all
folders that contain programs which require it. This will ensure that 
the correct exit code will be loaded into the programâ€™s context.

NOTE - This problem does not occur with Mac OS 8.0, Mac OS 8.6, 
or Mac OS 9.0.
