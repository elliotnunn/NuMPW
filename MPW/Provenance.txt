MPW 1.0.1
- https://macgui.com/downloads/?file_id=36940
- 1.0.0 released September 1986, this update in October
- skipped 1.0.0 because 1.0.1 only fixes a Shell memory leak
- correct folder structure (for HFS systems) reconstructed based on "MPW
  Reference 1.0" Appendix A
- Asm 1.0, Pascal (unknown version) and C 1.8.0
- yes, a C compiler, despite widespread belief that this was introduced with
  MPW 2.0

MPW 2.0 A3
- https://macgui.com/downloads/?file_id=36941
- alpha release from March 1987
- Asm 2.0, Pascal (unknown version) and C 1.8.0
- included here because it comes with a C compiler, unlike MPW 2.0.2
- applied the handful of include/lib file updates from "MPW A3 Supplement" disk

MPW 2.0.2
- https://macgui.com/downloads/?file_id=36943
- June 1987
- the only "final" MPW 2 release that I can find
- Asm 2.88 and Pascal (unknown version) only

- Asm, Pascal and C (all version 3.0)

MPW 3.1
- https://www.macintoshrepository.org/545-macintosh-programmer-s-workshop-mpw-3-x
  (same archive as above)
- October 1989
- Asm, Pascal and C (all version 3.1)

MPW 3.2
- ETO #4
- April 1991
- Asm, Pascal and C (all version 3.2)
- also integrated MPW C++ 3.1 from ETO #10 with this release, as recommended in
  that version's release note
- lived on as "MPW for 68000" as the last version not requiring an 020
- ostensibly 32-bit clean and suitable for System 7 development

MPW 3.2.3
- ETO #10
- June 1992
- Asm 3.2.2, Pascal 3.2.1 and C 3.2.4
- also integrated MPW C++ 3.2 from this CD, as recommended in that version's
  release note (but did not bring in C++'s older Link tool)

MPW 3.3.1
- ETO #15 (related versions found on ETO #12-17)
- July 1993
- skipped 3.3.0 because the libraries and tools had a fflush() crashing bug
- Asm 3.3.1, Pascal 3.3.2 and C 3.3.3
- inclusive of PPCAsm 1.0 and PPCC 1.0.1 from 1994 (in MPW folder on this CD)
- also integrated MPW C++ 3.3.1 from this CD
- left out the Symantec C and MrC compilers (separate on this CD)
- left out Interfaces & Libraries 2.0 (separate on this CD), keeping "old" ones

Noteworthy: MPW Pascal and MPW C were discontinued at this point, in favour of
SC/SC++ with Pascal support ended. The last releases seem to be Pascal 3.3.3
(Apple FTP) and C 3.4d1 (ETO #15 Prerelease MPW 3.4a7).
